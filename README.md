To try this on your very own iOS device, please clone the github repo into Xcode. Run a build onto your iOS device (you will need to enable developer mode on your iPhone), or try running it all in the SwiftUI preview. If you want to connect to your google drive while in the app, please email shayaant2006@gmail.com to be added to the testing group since otherwise Google has to approve the entire project before making it automatically public
